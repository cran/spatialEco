\description{
Calculates a variety of landscape metrics on integer rasters using focal approach
}
\details{
The following metrics are available: 
 \itemize{ 
  \item  class - a particular patch type from the original input matrix (mat).
  \item  n.patches - the number of patches of a particular patch type or in a class.
  \item  total.area - the sum of the areas (m2) of all patches of the corresponding patch type.
  \item  prop.landscape - the proportion of the total landscape represented by this class
  \item  patch.density - the numbers of patches of the corresponding patch type divided by total landscape area (m2).
  \item  total.edge - the total edge length of a particular patch type.
  \item  edge.density - edge length on a per unit area basis that facilitates comparison among landscapes of varying size.
  \item  landscape.shape.index - a standardized measure of total edge or edge density that adjusts for the size of the landscape.
  \item  largest.patch.index - largest patch index quantifies the percentage of total landscape area comprised by the largest patch.
  \item  mean.patch.area - average area of patches.
  \item  sd.patch.area - standard deviation of patch areas.
  \item  min.patch.area - the minimum patch area of the total patch areas.
  \item  max.patch.area - the maximum patch area of the total patch areas.
  \item  perimeter.area.frac.dim - perimeter-area fractal dimension equals 2 divided by the slope of regression line obtained by regressing the logarithm of patch area (m2) against the logarithm of patch perimeter (m).
  \item  mean.perim.area.ratio - the mean of the ratio patch perimeter. The perimeter-area ratio is equal to the ratio of the patch perimeter (m) to area (m2).
  \item  sd.perim.area.ratio - standard deviation of the ratio patch perimeter.
  \item  min.perim.area.ratio - minimum perimeter area ratio
  \item  max.perim.area.ratio - maximum perimeter area ratio.
  \item  mean.shape.index - mean of shape index
  \item  sd.shape.index - standard deviation of shape index.
  \item  min.shape.index - the minimum shape index.
  \item  max.shape.index - the maximum shape index.
  \item  mean.frac.dim.index - mean of fractal dimension index.
  \item  sd.frac.dim.index - standard deviation of fractal dimension index.
  \item  min.frac.dim.index - the minimum fractal dimension index.
  \item  max.frac.dim.index - the maximum fractal dimension index.
  \item  total.core.area - the sum of the core areas of the patches (m2).
  \item  prop.landscape.core - proportional landscape core
  \item  mean.patch.core.area - mean patch core area.
  \item  sd.patch.core.area - standard deviation of patch core area.
  \item  min.patch.core.area - the minimum patch core area.
  \item  max.patch.core.area - the maximum patch core area.
  \item  prop.like.adjacencies - calculated from the adjacency matrix, which shows the frequency with which different pairs of patch types (including like adjacencies between the same patch type) appear side-by-side on the map (measures the degree of aggregation of patch types).
  \item  aggregation.index - computed simply as an area-weighted mean class aggregation index, where each class is weighted by its proportional area in the landscape.
  \item  lanscape.division.index - based on the cumulative patch area distribution and is interpreted as the probability that two randomly chosen pixels in the landscape are not situated in the same patch
  \item  splitting.index - based on the cumulative patch area distribution and is interpreted as the effective mesh number, or number of patches with a constant patch size when the landscape is subdivided into S patches, where S is the value of the splitting index.
  \item  effective.mesh.size - equals 1 divided by the total landscape area (m2) multiplied by the sum of patch area (m2) squared, summed across all patches in the landscape.
  \item  patch.cohesion.index - measures the physical connectedness of the corresponding patch type.
