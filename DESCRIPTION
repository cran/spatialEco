Description: Utilities to support spatial data manipulation, query, sampling
    and modelling. Functions include models for species population density, download
    utilities for climate and global deforestation spatial products, spatial
    smoothing, multivariate separability, point process model for creating pseudo-
    absences and sub-sampling, polygon and point-distance landscape metrics,
    auto-logistic model, sampling models, cluster optimization, statistical
    exploratory tools and raster-based metrics.
